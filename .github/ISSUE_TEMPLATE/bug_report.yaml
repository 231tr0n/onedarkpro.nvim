          ## Test with a `minimal.lua` file
          I know the temptation is to skip this step but please don't. So many issues with the colorscheme are caused by other plugins overwriting highlight groups. This step helps to determine if the issue is actually with the plugin.

          Firstly, test and run Neovim with the minimal config below. Be sure to add your OneDarkPro config, saving to a `minimal.lua` file and adding any additional plugins you may need:
          ```lua
          local test_dir = "/tmp/onedarkpro"
          local root = vim.fn.fnamemodify(test_dir, ":p")

          -- set stdpaths to use .repro
          for _, name in ipairs({ "config", "data", "state", "cache" }) do
            vim.env[("XDG_%s_HOME"):format(name:upper())] = root .. "/" .. name
          end

          -- bootstrap lazy
          local lazypath = root .. "/plugins/lazy.nvim"
          if not vim.loop.fs_stat(lazypath) then
            vim.fn.system({
              "git",
              "clone",
              "--filter=blob:none",
              "--single-branch",
              "https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim.git",
              lazypath,
            })
          end
          vim.opt.runtimepath:prepend(lazypath)

          -- install plugins
          local plugins = {
            "olimorris/onedarkpro.nvim",
            { "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter", build = ":TSUpdate" },

            -- add any other plugins here
          }

          require("lazy").setup(plugins, {
            root = root .. "/plugins",
          })

          -- setup treesitter
          local ok, treesitter = pcall(require, "nvim-treesitter.configs")
          if ok then
            treesitter.setup({
              ensure_installed = "all",
              ignore_install = { "phpdoc" }, -- list of parser which cause issues or crashes
              highlight = { enable = true },
            })
          end

          -- setup onedarkpro
          local ok, onedarkpro = pcall(require, "onedarkpro")
          if ok then
            onedarkpro.setup({
              -- Your onedarkpro config here
            })
            vim.cmd("colorscheme onedark")
          end
          ```

          Once you've updated for your config, run Neovim with this command:
          ```sh
          nvim --clean -u minimal.lua
          ```
          > **Note:** You may need to do this a couple of times for Treesitter to fully download and sync
